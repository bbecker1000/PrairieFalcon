The slough flooded from heavy rain and then the flap gates were damaged and could not properly drain the slough into Moss Landing Harbor.,"An Atmospheric River event brought heavy rain and gusty winds with a strong winter storm that impacted the Bay Area for several days in mid-December. Cyclogenesis occurred with a 979 mb low forming off the Northern California coast. On December 11, the intense surface low moved up the coast and drug a narrow cold frontal rainband (NCFR) through the Bay Area that morning and early afternoon. NCFRs are rapidly moving fronts that are notorious for intense rainfall and gusty winds despite having limited instability. ||The NCFR wasn't a major wind producer, but the rainfall rates were impressive. Instantaneous rainfall rates of 1.5-2 inches/hr were reported. Observational data from the Big Sur Coast were also impressive with Big Sur receiving 4.43 in 2 hours and Flores Camp receiving 3 in 1 hour. It wasn't so much the total amount of rainfall for many locations, but the intensity and how much was received in a short amount of time. ||Many locations around the entire Bay Area had flooding: urban flooding of streets and highways, flooding of creeks and even one large river in the North Bay. Eventually the NCFR slowed around the Big Sur Coast. The stalling was likely due to another 'wave' in the atmosphere, farther to the southwest, riding along the boundary. The end result was to have the weakened NCFR lift back northward, almost like a quasi-warm front, producing another round of moderate to locally heavy rainfall around the Bay Area, compounding flooding concerns. ||In addition to the impressive rainfall, winds also became a problem for the water soaked ground, drought stressed trees and diseased trees. Peak winds occurred over the higher terrain with the Lick Observatory reporting 83 mph. Most low elevation areas saw much lower wind speeds.||Lastly, the intense winds over the coastal waters helped to generate a fresh swell that produced very dangerous surf with large breaking waves.

According to multiple accounts, the landspout began on the hillside NW of a small farm community, laying nearly flat a broad oak tree. As the landspout moved down the hill it likely went through a period of vortex stretching, allowing it to tighten up and spin a bit faster. Eyewitnesses say the landspout moved down off the hill and toward several small houses. It displaced two normal sized steel dumpsters about 30 yards in the direction of its travel. Along this flat land portion of the path the landspout encountered two oak trees, tearing off several large branches (3in diameter) and depositing them 20-30 yards away in a downpath direction. Damage assessment indicates the landspout weakened significantly while passing over several small housing structures and brushing by a barn. Once past these structures it encountered another downhill slope and re-intensified. The landspout then encountered a pole barn with a small to moderate size trailer parked beneath. There were no visible signs of damage to the trailer, but the pole barn showed significant roof damage. It is estimated that about half of the roof from the pole barn was damaged or torn off with this debris strewn about the area. Rotation is easily confirmed due to debris locations. Parts of the roof were thrown orthogonally to the right of the direction of movement, as far as 40 to 50 yards. Other portions of the roof were lifted up, taken with the landspout and scattered across a neighboring vineyard.

To attain some ground truth, WCM called petro facility that the convection crossed. He spoke with the plant supervisor who was from Texas and knows severe weather. The supervisor was able to provide photos and video of the hail falling and accumulating. He said at its peak, the hail had depths of about 3 inches, but just under dime size at most. The hail melted quickly and caused local ponding of water.||No impacts were reported.|See http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/stormSummary/SvrWx4_27_16/svrwx_4_27_16.php for pics and details.","The following can be found with photos and active links at:|http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/stormSummary/SvrWx4_27_16/svrwx_4_27_16.php||LSRMTR:|https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=LSRMTR&e=201604281650||A storm swept through the Bay Area on the 27th of April, bringing showers, thunderstorms and even a waterspout. An upper level trough and associated cold front entered the North Bay early in the day and then moved southward through the entire Bay Area by the afternoon. The passing frontal boundary and cold air aloft help to set the stage for afternoon thunderstorms. Computer weather models forecasted the mid to late afternoon thunderstorm potential rather well. The GFS model imagery below depicts the passage of the upper level trough/low and associated precipitation. The NAM model imagery below depicts forecast surface based convective available potential energy (CAPE). In other words, CAPE is the measure of instability in the lower atmosphere (full definition here). Note the higher values of CAPE over northern Napa County and southern Monterey/San Benito Counties.||The cold frontal passage earlier in the day brought mostly stratiform rain to the Bay Area impacting the morning commute. However, after noon enough instability was present and thunderstorms began to develop over Monterey/San Benito Counties. See the radar animation below. These developing thunderstorms continued to track south and develop even further (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Through radar interrogation it was determined that this particular thunderstorm contained hail. The question was, how big? After utilizing dual pol radar imagery and radar cross sections evidence was growing that larger hail could be present. One technique meteorologists use for analyzing hail is the strength of the radar returns above 0C and especially - 20C. In the image below, higher returns were easily seen above the 0C line and -20C. As a result, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued with the main threats being hail of one inch and wind gusts to 60 mph. We had one report of hail associated with thunderstorm. Enough hail fell to cover the ground white and make it look like it snowed (picture).||Another notable thunderstorm that developed during the afternoon was located over northern Napa County (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Thunderstorms developed north of Lake Berryessa and began tracking south(see radar image below). This particular thunderstorm eventually began to indicate weak rotation. The rotation detected on the KDAX radar ended up being a short-live waterspout. Confirmation of the waterspout was eventually reported via social media (see picture). In short, a waterspout is a tornado over water (full definition here).",98,,

Multiple days of triple digit afternoon highs were recorded inland with some coastal locations even reaching the mid 90s. Several days of hot and dry weather further dried fuels over the area increasing fire danger. During this event, a surge of monsoonal and tropical moisture from a former Tropical Storm advected northward with sufficient instability to generate multiple high based and dry thunderstorms that produced several thousand lightning strikes over the Greater Bay Area. Many locations saw wind gusts of 40-50 mph with isolated areas seeing gusts of 60-75 mph. This prompted the San Francisco Bay Area forecast office to issue a rare severe thunderstorm warning. These lightning strikes in combination with gusty and erratic outflow winds sparked hundreds of wildfires across the state of California.

An upper level disturbance passed over the region the 17th-18th leading to a tightening offshore pressure gradient before a second and stronger disturbance the 18th-19th tightened it further. This lead to two bursts of strong offshore winds. Higher elevations across the region reported gusts between 60 and 80 mph with two sites reaching 90. Lower elevations also were notably in excess of 40 mph. These winds resulted in tree damage, downed trees, and downed powerlines causing power outages. This all led to a rare January Red Flag Warning for Monterey and San Benito counties where fuels remained dry from lack of rainfall. Roughly a dozen small fires broke out in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with two becoming relatively large for January. Full storm summary https://www.weather.gov/mtr/Wind_1_17-19_2021.",373,,
